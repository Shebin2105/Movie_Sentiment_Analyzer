# Movie Sentiment Analyzer

## Overview
The **Movie Sentiment Analyzer** is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to analyze movie reviews and determine their sentiment â€” whether positive or negative. Leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques with transformer-based models (BERT), the application provides accurate real-time sentiment predictions.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in **natural language processing**, **sentiment analysis**, or building **interactive AI-powered apps**.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input any movie review and get instant sentiment analysis.  
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The model processes text quickly and returns results in real time.  
- **Visual Sentiment Distribution**: See graphical representations of sentiment scores and trends.  
- **Scalable NLP Model**: Built using a fine-tuned BERT model for high accuracy.  
- **Local and Cloud Ready**: Can be run locally or deployed to cloud platforms.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a **movie review dataset** containing 50,000 reviews labeled as positive or negative. Preprocessing includes **tokenization**, **padding**, and **encoding** to make it compatible with the BERT-based model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Streamlit** for web interface  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for BERT-based model  
- **PyTorch** for deep learning  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualizations
